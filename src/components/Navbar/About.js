          <p>
            Welcome to Doghouse-AirBNB, a full service dog resort and training center,
            We are trained & specialized pet care service providers. Our services range from pet sitting to pet grooming.
            The experience we have acquired in this field makes us aware of the needs of your pet even when you can not figure it out.
            We believe that every pet should be given tender love and care. It's our habit to make sure your pet leaves the Vet clinic feeling much healthier than they came.
            They may not always talk, but they always feel!
            At Canine Country Club your dog will receive the love and comfort that they deserve.
            Our luxury dog facility offers professional training services, dog grooming and boarding with amenities that will keep your pet exercised and entertained.
            We pride ourselves on maintaining a healthy and safe environment that will serve as a home away from home for your dog. Come to Canine Country Club where your dog will have its own vacation while you are away on vacation.

            We look forward to caring for you and your dog,
